# üß† Heart Failure Risk Prediction

A Machine Learning Project Dedicated to Saving Lives

---

## üéØ Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that predicts the risk of mortality due to heart failure. Special emphasis is placed on maximizing recall to ensure that high-risk patients are accurately identified and receive timely intervention.

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)
- **Features:** Age, Ejection Fraction, Serum Creatinine, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, and more.
- **Target Variable:** `DEATH_EVENT` (1 = Deceased, 0 = Survived)

---

## üß™ Models Evaluated

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Random Forest** (Selected for deployment based on superior recall performance)

---

## üîç Focus on Recall

In the healthcare domain, minimizing false negatives is critical, as failing to identify high-risk patients can have fatal consequences. By prioritizing recall, the model aims to capture as many true positive (high-risk) cases as possible, even if it results in a higher number of false positives.

- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Deployment:** Streamlit (for interactive web application and user interface)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## üß™ Models Trained & Evaluation

During the development of this project, several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict the risk of death from heart failure:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression    |   XX%    |   XX%     |  XX%   |   XX%    |
| Decision Tree          |   XX%    |   XX%     |  XX%   |   XX%    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    |   XX%    |   XX%     |  XX%   |   XX%    |
| **Random Forest**      | **YY%**  | **YY%**   | **YY%**| **YY%**  |

> **Note:** The Random Forest model was selected for deployment due to its superior recall, which is critical in healthcare applications to minimize false negatives.

### üìà Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision:** Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** Proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly (prioritized in this project).
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### üîç What is Recall?

Recall measures the proportion of actual positive cases (e.g., patients who are at risk of death from heart failure) that the model correctly identifies.

\[
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
\]

- **True Positives (TP):** Cases where the model correctly predicts a positive outcome (e.g., correctly identifies a high-risk patient).
- **False Negatives (FN):** Cases where the model fails to identify a positive outcome (e.g., misses a high-risk patient).

#### ü©∫ Why is Recall Important in Healthcare?

- **Minimizing False Negatives:** In medical settings, failing to identify a high-risk patient (a false negative) can have severe or fatal consequences.
- **Prioritizing Patient Safety:** By maximizing recall, the model ensures that as many high-risk patients as possible are flagged for further attention, even if it means some false alarms (false positives).

#### üìä Example

If your model has a recall of 0.90 (or 90%), it means it correctly identifies 90% of all actual high-risk patients.

#### üêç Python Example

```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
# y_true: true labels, y_pred: predicted labels
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
```
