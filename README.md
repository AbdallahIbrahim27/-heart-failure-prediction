🧠 Heart Failure Risk Prediction – ML Project Summary
📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict the risk of death due to heart failure, using clinical records — with a focus on maximizing recall to catch all actual positive cases (high-risk patients).

🗂 Dataset
Source: Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Features: Age, Ejection Fraction, Serum Creatinine, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, etc.

Target: Death Event (1 = death occurred, 0 = survived)

🧪 Models Explored
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

✅ Random Forest (Final Model)

🎯 Key Metric
Recall was prioritized over accuracy to minimize false negatives, ensuring high-risk patients are not missed.

🛠️ Tools & Tech
Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Streamlit (for deployment and GUI)

Git & GitHub

🌐 Deployment
A user-friendly Streamlit app was developed to allow users to input patient data and receive instant predictions.
