🧠Heart Failure Risk Prediction
A Machine Learning Project Focused on Saving Lives

🎯 Goal
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the risk of death from heart failure, with a focus on maximizing recall to ensure high-risk patients are correctly identified.

📊 Dataset
Source: Heart Failure Clinical Records (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)

Features: Age, Ejection Fraction, Serum Creatinine, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes, etc.

Target: DEATH_EVENT (1 = died, 0 = survived)

🧪 Models Compared
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

✅ Random Forest (selected for deployment based on recall performance)

🔍 Why Recall?
In healthcare, false negatives can be fatal.
Prioritizing recall ensures we capture as many true positive (high-risk) cases as possible — even at the expense of some false positives.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Streamlit: for interactive deployment and GUI
